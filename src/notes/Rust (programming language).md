Attempting to familiarize myself with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), with the ultimate goal of being able to do [[Audio programming]] such as making my own VSTs. Here are notes on my self-learning and about the language in general.

## how to learn

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hXNd6x9sZs)recommends using a combination of:
- [*The Rust Programming Language* (aka "the book")](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)
- [*Rust by Example*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

## "The book"

### Ch 2 

> The `&` indicates that this argument is a _reference_, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature, and one of Rustâ€™s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use references.

> [`Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/result/enum.Result.html) is an [_enumeration_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch06-00-enums.html), often called an _enum_, which is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each possible state a _variant_.
