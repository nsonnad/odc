[Spirit Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island) is a cooperative, anticolonial board game. The premise is that European invaders are attempting to colonize an island, and players play as the elemental spirits that inhabit the island—the home of the Dahan people—who work together to repel the invaders through fear, intimidation, and destruction.

It is a very fun, and reasonably complex, game. Particularly in a world where most such games have mechanics that reflect the values of our colonial, capitalist, destructive world. Spirit Island rewards not competition but cooperation, not extracting from the land but protecting it.

Anyway, an the politics of this game could be its own whole essay. Maybe I'll write it some day.

But for now, I just want to leave notes on strategy for those starting out playing.
