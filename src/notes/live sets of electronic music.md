## live sets of electronic dance music

this document contains my latest thoughts on how to approach playing live sets of improvised, electronic dance music. i use `e d m` just as a descriptor and not as the genre, of course, but like, any music that is electronic and that ppl are dancing to.

i don't have a lot of experience playing live sets. i hope to get more. but for now, this is just what i've learned from being a musician and listening to live sets, thinking about what has worked in past dj sets, and most importantly, what i've felt on a great dancefloor.

it's important to keep that in mind. the main goal is always: to rock the dancefloor. to give people that experience of giving themselves over to their bodies, of being connected to everyone else on the dancefloor, of having a shared human time. of losing themselves in the music. this is what a great dj does (or a great band) and that is what we are trying to do, through our music. there may be other goals like, doing something "cool" or "having fun" or "making money" but in my mind the music is best when the music is 4 the people, one of whom is you (me).

this might seem a bit abstract or high-minded or unnecessary, but i'm here to say that it is actually the primacy of the dancer's experience that makes improvised sets of `e d m` such a special medium. a dancefloor is a moment in time. for many, in many contexts, this moment is an escape, a space outside the unbearable weight ofâ€”society-as-it-is. this transgressive need is what informs the music, not the other way around. it is bottom-up. (bottoms-up?)

and bottom-up [audio clip of "BOTTOM-UP BOTTOM-UP BOTTOMS-UP BOTTOMS-UP jersey club beat that i make lol"] is what you are as the performer of a live set. you are the conduit. you are the expression of the energy that exists on the dancefloor. you are there to serve it and nourish it. and that means: listening. this is the single most important thing: you must listen.
