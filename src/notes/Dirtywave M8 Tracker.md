Notes, tricks, shortcuts, ideas about how to get the most musical fun out of the [Dirtywave M8](https://dirtywave.com/products/m8-tracker). 

### My setup

I don't have an actual M8. I run it headless on my laptop using a [Teensy 4.1](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html) and a [Switch Pro Controller](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/pro-controller/). I'm extremely grateful and a bit in awe that the lone creator of this thing has open-sourced the software and written a [very detailed guide](https://github.com/DirtyWave/M8Docs/blob/main/docs/M8HeadlessSetup.md) on how to set it up. I'd love to buy a real M8, but they're expensive and on back-order indefinitely.

In the future, I'd like to run my headless M8 through something like an [Anbernic RG351V](https://anbernic.com/collections/best-sellers/products/anbernic-new-rg351v?variant=40986761167012) or perhaps a Steam Deck if I end up feeling like it's worth buying one of those.

### What is the M8?

The M8 is a [music tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker) that runs on a Teensy microcontroller (a lil computer). It features a delightful, game-like workflow heavily inspired by [Little Sound DJ](https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php), a tracker that runs on a Game Boy. But the M8 offers way more musical possibilities than LSDJ, with multiple synth engines, a full-featured sampler, effects, LFOs, envelopes—enough possibilities to make complete songs and albums.

Producing music on a tracker takes some getting used to but is powerful and compact, and offers a workflow that is nicely limited and opinionated; ultimately the M8 is nice in that it's not as daunting as a full DAW.
