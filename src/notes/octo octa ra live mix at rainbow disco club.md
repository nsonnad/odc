## octo octa ra live mix at rainbow disco club

notes on this mix, one of my all time faves. taken from [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra-live-20180429-octo-octa-rainbow-disco-club-shizuoka?in_system_playlist=personalized-tracks%3A%3Aeoeoeoeo%3A499264809)

### questions

how does it unfold? how long do things go on for? what is the trajectory? the pacing? are there parts where things get boring? how is momentum maintained?

### takeaways

to me, the structure of this is fairly straightforward. and is very much the same general idea as a dj set, namely to start a song, let it go through its narrative, then blend it with parts of another song, then let the new song take over and go through its narrative, and so on.

it's important when performing an improvised live set to remember that the larger narrative (the set) must contain many small narratives (tracks). it's easy to get stuck in the mindset of just pushing the grand narrative forward, but no, it's like chapters in a book, each one its own little story that adds up to something greater. this is key for the listeners/dancers, because they need to be able to have that feeling of familiarity and intimacy that comes from repetition. they need to be able to really get to know the characters of each of your chapters, not just see a fleeting reference to them. and yes, these characters will encounter conflict, have low lows and high highs, and things will always be happening to them. but there is something to latch on to.

this is also important for the musician, though, because it gives us time to settle into a groove. to explore an idea and not just try to be frantically coming up with a new one. the dancers want this, too.

here are some related concrete observations i made listening closely to a personal favorite set, [octo octa live at rainbow disco club](https://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra-live-20180429-octo-octa-rainbow-disco-club-shizuoka?in_system_playlist=personalized-tracks%3A%3Aeoeoeoeo%3A499264809) (i believe, based on [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYVPOOJNsYQ) with octo octa, that this a prepared live-ish set, where she essentially pre-loads samples of the individual elements of tracks she produced in ableton or whatever, but also sequences some of the parts live on synthesizers and even improvises new parts entirely.) 

at pretty much any moment in the entire set, there is the feeling of what i'm gonna call an "established thing". this could be: a hook, a groove, a theme, even a "vibe." usually it's some combination of many things and is really primarily just "a vibe." but it's what makes this kind of dance music work, i think. the feeling that there is a core thing that repeats and does not change in a fundamental way (though may evolve, rise and fall, etc), while other things dance around it. it's something to latch on to, to provide that familiarity.

take the dual-synth theme that first begins to appear around 10:50 (percussive first synth) and picks up around 11:40 (more melodic, higher sencond synth). she varies these sounds a lot, and in super cool ways, but both synths are playing basically the exact same 1-bar phrase all the way until the next track enters at 16:30 (i.e. 5 minutes later)

so, you start by: establishing a thing. then you: develop that thing, alter that thing, explore that thing, but make sure it stays, fundamentally, that thing. once you've done that for like, 4-9 minutes, you start establishing another thing, and then you do it all over again.  because the structure of a dancefloor session is a bit particularâ€”you want the repetition, but you don't want sameness. you have to move through these different "things/vibes/feels" and put interesting ones next to each other.

questions: how does it unfold? how long do things go on for? what is the trajectory? the pacing? are there parts where things get boring? how is momentum maintained?


- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=02:06.090]]

this part is pretty chill really. like, it grooves beautifully but you wouldn't be dancing your face off to it. important to think about grooves that aren't like full on energy.

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=03:22.666]]

first really "full" sounding part

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=03:52.310]]

but then it's given more space

drops out kick for 8 bars and starts varying synth parameters for a minute or so here, otherwise mostly unchanged.

i'm thinking it's important to really _develop_ a given idea once it's there, as if it were a track. with a track, you need to take things out and put them back, have different parts talk to each other, and so on. so we should be making a "track", developing it, then mixing in to the next track, developing that one, and so on. i think we can spend more time at the "developing" stage 

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=04:52.830]]

new synth part for 4 then >

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=05:00.000]]

NEW KICK

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=05:06.745]]

bit of a "mix" phase here involving new kick and new synth

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=05:31.776]]

this is a very "set up" section, there is very little happening but it is building suspense for something. it seems like it could just roll on for a while with minimal changes i think we could have rolling sections like this while we come up with a new "hook"

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=06:16.534]]

slow build into a new hook

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=07:06.982]]

it's important here that this fells like a "drop" into the next track / soundspace. like we should be able to create that effect somehow -- maybe agree to both switch it up in a minute, like both have a new idea to introduce at the same time (love this idea)

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=08:26.934]]

yes, this is just the _developing_ of this track and creating tons of suspense by just removing things, adjusting parameters, mixing and matching differently, fx, etc

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=11:27.444]]

this "track" lasts as the main idea for like 5.5 minutes before a new idea clearly starts to take over:

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=11:55.958]]

new track takes over completely now and actually just unfolds in a wonderful, long and patient build up, really taking its time

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=14:43.959]]

hell yessss just taking the exact groove but adding freaky weird shit to it

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=14:52.115]]

then going into a freaky weird breakdown

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=15:31.201]]

aaand new kick and into mixing a new track, though the previous theme continues to be the main element for another minute or so

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=17:06.332]]

next track is now the main idea

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=17:46.462]]

now we start developing this track. do a breakdown, come back in with more drums. also just one of my favorite tracks ever!

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=20:17.703]]

i'm noticing here just how gradual this is for the most part. things are always changing, but more on the level of like 8-16 bars than like, constantly. and like, the changes every 8-16 bars are often very subtle, like, removing a drum thing and adding a synth thing, or removing a few things, etc, but it's all just kind of patiently moving along

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=21:56.483]]

well ok that part is a little abrupt (and fun because of it). but also i think it's because it's the beginning of a mix and too much shit probably came in at once. looks like ~5-6min per "track" is staying fairly consistent

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=22:53.675]]

next track is the main idea. this one had a queued-up kick and bass to go with it which made the transition sound (and more importantly, feel) sick

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=22:58.779]]

and here we have "development". a breakdown that leads into really a more stripped-down version of the groove that we can develop, build back up but in a different way this time.

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=24:01.351]]

deconstructing it even more. also this whole track is like pretty weird and freakish and also one of those "rolling" parts that doesn't seem to change much. which is just to say you can have a track or section of just a simple drum part and some fucked up synths and turn some knobs and it will sound dope

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=25:34.483]]

bringing the energy down even more here. i also think "container" is particularly adept at these kinds of parts

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=26:12.030]]

building back up, weirding it up

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=27:14.868]]

and now, basically nothing. good opportunity to mix in a new idea~

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=27:39.335]]

new track

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=29:20.913]]

honestly i'm not that into this track, find it kind of boring and plodding. i would totally take a break here if i were at this show, or at least like let my mind wander for a bit. and it goes on like this for a while! though it still develops itself over a track-like length of time, building and unfolding over 5-6 minutes. i think this is important, because this kind of music does still just sort of entrance you or allow you to zone out to the beat, or it can sound interesting and cool if you're like, far from the dancefloor and chatting, or at the bar, etc, it can entice you to want to head back, it's all part of the experience (the repetition)

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=31:38.439]]

new track finally getting mixed in. but happens quite slowly

- [[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=33:01.439]]

new track is main idea

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=33:57.524]]

very common move here (as happening here) is:

1. blend the main hook of the old song with the new
2. transition over to the new
3. let it set there with the basic new groove and hook for a minute
4. that new groove goes into a spacey breakdown
5. fully establish the mood of the new track

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=37:12.341]]
again this is a bit of a low-excitement section/track i think, but it still moves things forward and prob sounds a lot different on a big system

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=38:55.962]]
again this new track has a bunch of stuff that comes in at once, melody, hook, drums, etc. good to try to queue something like this up somehow when improvving

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=41:39.789]]
don't forget the power of some corny dj fx

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=44:03.012]]
it's also important to leave and come back some times. esp cool for a mix like here

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=45:33.953]]
here begins a very good slow build on a theme. something like this easy enough for us to improvise (with practice)

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=47:10.025]]
payoffffffffff for that build

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=49:00.163]]
wow

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=49:38.381]]
this one is so good that all she needs to do is just develop it very subtly and calmly

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=54:14.972]]
that section went for like 10min

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=54:58.623]]
important to have clear shifts in tone and just _move on_ to the next thing, and leave the last thing behind (after a section of mixing possibly, of course)

[[RA Live-2018.04.29-Octo-Octa-Rainbow Disco Club-Shizuoka.mp3#t=01:08:48.792]]
very cool vibe shift after an extended weird breakdown loop
