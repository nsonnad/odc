Congee is rice porridge that's eaten all acrossa Asia, and it's the best thing to have around as the weather gets colder! It's most often eaten for breakfast, but it honestly hits the spot at any time of day.

Once you get the knack for making the porridge you can put anything you want in it—use it to clean out the fridge!

Ingredients:

- 1 cup white rice
- 9 cups water
- 3-4 inch chunk of ginger, minced
- 1/4 cup mirin (optional, but adds a really nice layer)
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 6 scallions, chopped
- Whatever veggies you want! Leafy greens and mushrooms are best
- Great additions if you have access to a market with Chinese foods: firm-pressed tofu (豆乾, dougan) and preserved mustard greens (碎米芽菜, suimi yacai)
- Chili oil for a bit of kick (optional)

Method:

Heads up: Kind of like risotto, congee involves a lot of stirring in order to release rice starch and create a gluey texture. 

- Bring water to a boil in a large pot and wash your rice
- With water boiling, add rice and bring water back to a boil
- Stir thoroughly then cook rice at high heat for 10 minutes
- After 10 minutes are up, and stir again, turn heat to low, and cover pot while leaving room for steam to escape
- Cook for an additional 30 minutes at low heat, stirring occasionally (every 5 minutes or so)
- After 30 minutes, add sesame oil to the pot
- Put heat back on high and cook for another 10-15 minutes, stirring more or less continuously
- Add ginger, mirin, and the white parts of scallions and stir for two minutes to let these flavor get absorbed
- Add remaining veggies!
- Dish into a bowl and top with any of: preserved mustard greens, chili oil, and the green parts of scallions
- Stir and enjoy!
